       " \"the most over rated airline ! customer service is the worst that i 've experienced ground crews were downright rude we asked one of the ground crew for priority boarding since we were travelling with our six month old baby but he only told us to go to the end of the queue in a very rude way during the boarding they did not call priority boarding for elderly disabled passengers and passengers travelling with babies cabin crews were equally as rude and dismissive for goodness sake we are your customers and your job is to give us good service we are never flying emirates anymore especially going anywhere to asia\",\n",
       " \"dubai to bangkok check-in was smooth but the boarding procedure was chaotic with different employees shouting contradictory messages to passengers on board we had a forty-five minute delay without even an apology just a quick word from the captain that we were waiting for a passenger and that made us miss our time slot for taking off ! when i asked a flight attendant about the delay she kept laughing and saying `` it 's fine no problem '' i believe a polite apology has to be issued i observed a lack of professionalism among staff i encountered the seat was comfortable enough but my table top was broken the movie selection was very limited for my tastes\",\n",
       " 'beirut to dubai the whole trip was fine related to staff service welcoming however we have moved to the bus and we waited like two thousand and twenty-five mins just because one passenger lost something all the passengers in the bus waited until this passenger came in this was unacceptable as this can be managed differently and all the crew have left before us',\n",
       " 'melbourne to singapore staff are generally rude at the check in counter they did not allow us to bring our laptop bag up together with cabin size bag even though it fulfilled all stated requirements it caused us a lot of hassle and loss furthermore the staff were rude when dealing with us similarly on the plane here noticed the attendants treating some passengers more dismissively inflight entertainment system is outdated compared to other international airlines will not fly emirates again',\n",

       " \"the most over rated airline ! customer service is the worst that i 've experienced ground crews were downright rude we asked one of the ground crew for priority boarding since we were travelling with our six month old baby but he only told us to go to the end of the queue in a very rude way during the boarding they did not call priority boarding for elderly disabled passengers and passengers travelling with babies cabin crews were equally as rude and dismissive for goodness sake we are your customers and your job is to give us good service we are never flying emirates anymore especially going anywhere to asia\",\n",
       " \"dubai to bangkok check-in was smooth but the boarding procedure was chaotic with different employees shouting contradictory messages to passengers on board we had a forty-five minute delay without even an apology just a quick word from the captain that we were waiting for a passenger and that made us miss our time slot for taking off ! when i asked a flight attendant about the delay she kept laughing and saying `` it 's fine no problem '' i believe a polite apology has to be issued i observed a lack of professionalism among staff i encountered the seat was comfortable enough but my table top was broken the movie selection was very limited for my tastes\",\n",
       " 'beirut to dubai the whole trip was fine related to staff service welcoming however we have moved to the bus and we waited like two thousand and twenty-five mins just because one passenger lost something all the passengers in the bus waited until this passenger came in this was unacceptable as this can be managed differently and all the crew have left before us',\n",
       " 'melbourne to singapore staff are generally rude at the check in counter they did not allow us to bring our laptop bag up together with cabin size bag even though it fulfilled all stated requirements it caused us a lot of hassle and loss furthermore the staff were rude when dealing with us similarly on the plane here noticed the attendants treating some passengers more dismissively inflight entertainment system is outdated compared to other international airlines will not fly emirates again',\n",
       " 'add-dxb-bkk on fourteen june two thousand and nineteen on zero and a380 respectively first flight good and hardware good but food was a complete let down i tried my special meal acknowledge ! and all the other three menu dishes announced all were absolutely substandard and not edible and i am not difficult and usually eat the dogs leftovers but this was horrible and hazardous food in economy was edible and better than business there was a cheese plate that helped me to avoid to starve no ice creams and no inspirational additionals rate six hundred and ten dubai-bangkok was a great experience as good as it gets on an airplane a380 must be the king of the skies likely of my best flight ever despite i had not slept the night before i doubt that a general one class experience can beat this luxurious bz-class experience by emirates on the a380 simply outstanding on seat “ hut ” meals drinks the onboard sky bar is a solid social effort and gimmick that is impressive and hard to dislike i like the outer seats in the one hundred and twenty-one biz-configuration with lots of space and great window access the sports car design works well for me and the wifi is solid and a bonus special meal was sophisticated and made to perfection rate one thousand and ten lounge provided in addis is the ethiopian cloud nine lounge which is slightly better than their gold lounge seems this lounge is improving due to emirates as they now serve the same champagne available on board',\n",
       " 'bali to dubai the customer service is amazing and so patient mustufa from their dubai customer center just helped me out flawlessly our line got disconnected before the changes were completed and he was amazing enough to complete everything and send me a confirmation email !',\n",
       " 'bangkok to hong kong overall disappointed check in lounge of the standard expected food in the bangkok lounge was very good as good as any ek lounge globally including dubai flight was full service was poor catering below average and service disjointed main course went cold waiting for wine and dessert was inedible gave feedback to cabin crew who tried to blame a catering in bangkok isn ’ t as good as dubai and b they were one crew member down due to illness frankly i don ’ t care if catering is subpar out out bangkok then are ticket prices reduced because of it no so don ’ t blame the catering own the issue as many here have posted emirates has lost its edge staff have a mixed understanding of food and beverage service and emirates is all show and lacks substance where it counts',\n",
       " 'singapore to venice via dubai as a regular of qatar and etihad on the singapore-europe route this was my first time with emirates i would not call it a total disappointment but the company is definitely and sadly not worth its fame positive aspects new aircrafts comfortable economy seats with decent pitch nice food plus points for the metal cutlery efficient ground staff seat selection is not complimentary and the cost disproportionate the cheapest option for each of the four legs of my journey would have increased the ticket price by around seventeen ! cabin service is close to no-frill airlines no hot towel no amenity kit no staff walking around the aisle with trays of drinks during sleeping hours the inflight entertainment on the a380 was a quite unresponsive touch screen with cursor charging plugs are only available to window and central seat worse part the staff i was told that an increasing number of europeans had joined emirates from ryanair and i was displeased to see the same attitude brought to the four airline apart from the lack of smiles and rough replies to some passengers that i could hear the staff onboard the sin-dxb night flight had been talking and laughing loudly in the galley for at least one hour after the light were switched off going in and out without caring to seal the courtains i have not seen such behaviour even on cheap low-cost carriers like scoot or airasia where the staff at least excercises the basic courtesy of letting their passengers sleep with prices that are in line with its competitors in the region i do not see the reason for me to fly emirates again',\n",
       " 'dubai to hyderabad i had booked a chauffeur drive at thirteen point zero five on three june with pick up point and location details clearly marked on the map while booking online after numerous calls with driver call center of emirates nobody showed up to pick me up even after thirteen after wasting and waiting for almost fifty minutes in hot sun i finally took a taxi and paid to reach business arrivals terminal and neither luggage concierge nor staff bothered to help me with my luggage from taxi nor to push the trolley i met duty manager and explained whole story and all he said was it ’ s okay we apologize but now please board the flight as you are late such a horrible customer service i never expected from emirates especially when traveling in business class on-board experience it ’ s ramadan fasting month for muslims month and i was fasting cabin crew informed me if am fasting then food will be served when it ’ s time to break my fasting but i should order the food in advance so that i get served when it was time of breaking my fasting i asked for the food that was ordered in advance and very surprisingly crew told sorry we can ’ t serve the food and you need to adjust with a small sandwich box as we are planning to land when i questioned crew why did they promised me to order food in advance and how can they deny serving the food for a fasting person then crew simply said it ’ s our policy and we can ’ t help when i became furious then they simply gave me a quick main course to eat but i felt their frustration while getting served i wasn ’ t served the food which i had preordered despite crew having enough time around one hour was left to land the flight most of the passengers sitting around me enjoyed full meal all items of menu but i had to go through this bad experience because i was fasting crew argued a lot with me to explain that full meal will be served only during initial serving time and not later even if someone is fasting i finally gave up arguing with the crew as i felt really embarrassed to ask for food again and again',\n",
       " 'milan to new york a very solid product in business class with huge lounge at milan and chaffeur service both at origin and destination a380 is top notch in terms of comfort and quietness cabin crew warm polite and efficient i found a good improvement on catering quality and staff service in the air and at the airport only qatar airways beat emirates with service',\n",
